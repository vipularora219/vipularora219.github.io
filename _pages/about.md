I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, with a focus on complexity theory. I currently work in property testing of functions and distributions. Before my PhD studies, I dabbled in arithmetic circuits for my M.Sc. Thesis, and data streaming algorithms for my B.Tech. Project. I am passionate about solving hard computational questions, because they are challenges that give us an opportunity to understand the world from an algorithmic lens. The computational landscape is open for everyone to improve upon.
